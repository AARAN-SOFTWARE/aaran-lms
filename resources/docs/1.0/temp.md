# PHP

PHP: Laravel has specific PHP version requirements.  V8.2

You can check your PHP version by running

php -v

in your terminal.

If you don't have PHP installed or need a different version, you'll need to install or update it.  How you do this depends on your operating system (e.g., using a package manager like apt, yum, brew, or downloading from php.net).

Composer: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies.  You must have Composer installed.  Download and install Composer from getcomposer.org.  After installation, you can verify it by running composer -v in your terminal.

Web Server (Optional but Recommended): While you can use PHP's built-in server for development (php artisan serve), a full-fledged web server like Apache or Nginx is recommended, especially for production environments.  If you're developing locally, you might consider using a development environment like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP (depending on your OS) which bundles Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

Database (Optional but Usually Needed): Most Laravel applications interact with a database. Choose a database system you want to use (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.) and ensure it's installed and configured.  Laravel's configuration files will need your database credentials.

Operating System: Laravel runs on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  The installation process might vary slightly depending on your OS.

Terminal/Command Prompt: You'll need to use the terminal or command prompt to execute commands during the Laravel installation and development process.

Git (Optional but Highly Recommended): Git is a version control system.  While not strictly required for installation, using Git is highly recommended for managing your Laravel project's code and collaborating with others.

In summary, before you begin the Laravel installation, make absolutely sure you have the correct PHP version and Composer installed.  The other prerequisites are important, but you can often install them as needed during the development process.  Always refer to the official Laravel documentation for the most up-to-date and detailed installation instructions and requirements.

Now your Laravel project is fully set up! ðŸš€
