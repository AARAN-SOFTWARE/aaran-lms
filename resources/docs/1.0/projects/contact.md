## User Contact:

- **Contact Form** : Users can contact the website’s team through a contact form. This form might include fields like the user's name, email address, subject of the inquiry, and a message box where the user can describe their issue or question. It allows users to reach out for support, feedback, or general inquiries without needing to open their email client. It's a straightforward way to handle communication from users.

- **Accessibility** : The contact form should be easy to find on the website, perhaps with a prominent button or link in the site’s navigation. It's important that users can get in touch quickly when they have questions or need assistance.

## Admin Contact Management:

- **View Contact Submissions** : Admins will be able to view all contact form submissions. This gives them the ability to review queries or feedback that users have submitted, allowing them to respond appropriately. Admins can access the contact information submitted, such as the name and message of the user, and can reply via email or through the system.

- **Permissions** : Admins **cannot** create, update, or delete contact information within the system. This restriction helps ensure that users' information remains secure and that only authorized individuals manage contact details. The role of the admin is limited to viewing and responding to user queries.
