# Learning Path for Laravel Preparation

---
Before diving into Laravel, it's essential to build a strong foundation by first learning the basics of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. These are the core technologies of web development and will help you understand how web pages are structured, styled, and made interactive. Once you're comfortable with these, the next step is to learn `PHP basics`, as Laravel is a PHP framework. After that, learn how to use `GitHub`, including creating repositories, making contributions, handling pull requests, merging changes, pushing code, and managing version control. Mastering these skills will prepare you for collaborative development and make your transition into Laravel much smoother.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown:
