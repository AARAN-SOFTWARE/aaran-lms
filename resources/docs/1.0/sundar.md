Laravel is a PHP framework designed for building web applications. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, making it structured and maintainable. Here’s how it works:

1. Routing (Web Entry Point)

When a user requests a URL, Laravel’s router (routes/web.php for web routes) determines which controller or action should handle the request.
	•	Example route:

Route::get('/welcome', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});



2. Controllers (Handling Requests)

Controllers process requests, retrieve data from models, and return responses (like views or JSON for APIs).
	•	Example controller method:

class UserController extends Controller {
    public function index() {
        $users = User::all(); 
        return view('users.index', compact('users'));
    }
}



3. Models (Interacting with the Database)

Laravel uses Eloquent ORM to work with databases using an object-oriented approach.
	•	Example model:

class User extends Model {
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password'];
}



4. Views (Rendering UI with Blade)

Views are stored in the resources/views folder and use Laravel’s Blade templating engine for dynamic content.
	•	Example Blade view (users/index.blade.php):

@foreach ($users as $user)
    <p>{{ $user->name }}</p>
@endforeach



5. Middleware (Filtering Requests)

Middleware sits between requests and responses, handling authentication, logging, etc.
	•	Example: Redirecting unauthenticated users

class Authenticate {
    public function handle($request, Closure $next) {
        if (!auth()->check()) {
            return redirect('/login');
        }
        return $next($request);
    }
}



6. Artisan (Command-Line Tool)

Laravel has a built-in CLI tool called Artisan to manage migrations, seeders, models, and more.
	•	Example command:

php artisan make:model Product -m

This creates a Product model and a migration file.

7. Migrations & Seeders (Database Management)

Migrations manage database schema changes using PHP instead of SQL.
	•	Example migration:

public function up() {
    Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('name');
        $table->decimal('price', 8, 2);
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}

Summary: How Laravel Works in a Request Lifecycle
	1.	User requests a URL → Laravel’s router matches it to a route.
	2.	Route calls a controller → Controller processes the request.
	3.	Controller queries the model → Model fetches data from the database.
	4.	Controller returns a view → View renders the page using Blade.
	5.	User sees the response in their browser.
